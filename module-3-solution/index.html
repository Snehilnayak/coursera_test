          Festivals form a very important aspect of human lives. They celebrate brotherhood, sharing, and the social nature of humans. One such festival is Diwali. It is celebrated by Hindus to mark the arrival of Ayodhya’s King Rama after a fierce and bloody battle with the demon king Ravana. It celebrates the basic theme of the victory of light against the dark. Our human minds are well-equipped with the ethos of social and behavioral patterns that form intricate relationships with people around us.Festivals are the perfect way to know your neighbors and celebrate with them. Diwali teaches us to be kind to everyone and has a patient heart and mind to wait for good results to come through. Our beliefs shape our minds; therefore, we must never lose faith in festivals. Diwali has long been associated with bursting crackers but, is it necessary? Of course not! Diwali can still be celebrated amazingly if we all stay at home and enjoy a hearty dinner with our friends and family. Bursting of firecrackers releases harmful gases to the atmosphere that ultimately results in air pollution.Festivals form a very important aspect of human lives.
